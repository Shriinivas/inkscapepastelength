# Paste Length Inkscape Extension
This effect makes the length of all the destination paths the same as that of the source path, while maintaining their shapes.<br>
The source is the topmost path in the selection. <br>

# Installation
Copy paste_length.py and paste_length.inx in the user extension folder. The extension folder can be found from Edit->Preference dialog in the System option. You will need to restart inkscape after the files are copied.

# Usage
The effect is under Extensions->Modify Path menu. 'Scale From' value is the origin point of scaling. Scale Factor applies additional scaling on top of the copied length. Precision is the degree of accuracy.<br>
